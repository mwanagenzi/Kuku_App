    <string name="health_text">Health Symptoms: Bone and leg deformation and feather loss. The birds walk with difficulty; they limp. Some deficiencies may cause feather loss.

Nutritional diseases may be avoided when the birds have access to normal vegetation and are therefore rare in scavenging chickens.</string>
